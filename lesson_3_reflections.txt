When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    >When you are not before your PC like using a mobile device or just make a small change like modify readme.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    >Because a change may includes several commits, you might not want to make it public before you finish it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    >Forks copy repository from other's account to my account on github server; clones copy repository from github to my pc or from one pc to another; while branch make new branch on a project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    >I can easily access it even without internet, and can do merge offline.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    >Use group chat tools to disscuss the change, send code to one or another. With github is more efficient and cause less mistake.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    >When I work in a large group, I want to sync with other's work, namely the master, I use branch. Modify directly in master is easy to achieve. But when collaberators get large, they have different progress, it's hard to keep all thing in master.
