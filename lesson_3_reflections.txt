When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    >When you are not before your PC like using a mobile device or just make a small change like modify readme.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    >Because a change may includes several commits, you might not want to make it public before you finish it.
